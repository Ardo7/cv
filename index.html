  <!-- there are two options of adding an image, one you copy the image adress
  and paste inside the src. second one requires you to add the image to the fol
  der where keep the website. go into the html personal site and drag it beside
  the index html. then you come back to this page, create a folder named images
  and drag the name of the picture, in this case ocean.jpeg, into the images
  folder. Finally you need to direct the image so you add images/ocean.jpeg.
  REMEMBER THE IF THE INTERNET OR WEBSITE GOES DOWN, AND YOU USED THE IMAGE
  ADDRESS OPTION, IT WILL NOT SHOW. this wont be a problem for option 2</!-->

<!-- i was able to fix the mistakes by simply going back to the example and
compare it to my code. I realized that i made the mistake because i ski
pped some steps on the first try;cant allow simple mistakes to discourage me
from going back, fixing my mistakes, and completeing as it is. PAY ATTENTION TO
THE CODE ON A FREQUENT BASIS SO I WONT HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS I HAVE
FIXING THE CODE. Wasnt alot but its something could have been preveneted.</!-->
